## Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm currently working on finite element and least‑squares finite element solvers in Python for advection–diffusion–reaction, Stokes, and incompressible Navier–Stokes problems (Newtonian / non‑Newtonian) with mesh adaptivity. Next steps will include the theory of porous media (multiphase materials), fluid–structure interaction, and physics‑informed neural networks.
